      <title>Combating Misinformation on Online Social Platform</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Paper (This work is published in 2023 21st International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks (WiOpt)): &lt;a href=&#34;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10349848&#34;&gt;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10349848&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;motivation&#34;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Misinformation has become a growing issue on online social platforms (OSPs), especially during elections or pandemics. To combat this, OSPs have implemented various policies, such as tagging, to notify users about potentially misleading information. However, these policies are often transparent and therefore susceptible to being exploited by content creators, who may not be willing to invest effort into producing authentic content, causing the viral spread of misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Privacy and Energy-Aware Split Deep Learning in Edge Camera Network</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Paper (This work is published in IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management): &lt;a href=&#34;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9941479&#34;&gt;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9941479&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lucileee5657.github.io/images/edge-camera-coalition/edge-camera.png&#34; alt=&#34;Edge Camera Network&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;motivation&#34;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recently, an increasing amount of application tasks have depended on deep learning (DL) inference models on Internet of Things (IoT) based camera networks. However, it is challenging to perform the inference of such resource-hungry DL models on the computationally limited IoT system. Compared to cloud computing, edge computing deploys resources near the end-users to reduce the transmission delay and retains the raw data on the trusted servers to mitigate privacy concerns. Since resources at the edge are limited, management like user association decisions, edge resources allocation, and device configuration with DL model parameter selection becomes essential.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

However, performing the inference tasks for DL applications on IoT devices is challenging due to the large computational demands of DL models. Recently, edge computing has offered us a solution by deploying resources near the end users. However, resources at the edge are still limited; thus, management issues, such as allocating the networking resources as well as the computing capabilities and configuring the devices appropriately for different applications, become essential.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
