      <title>Adaptive Navigational Recommendations for Urban Transportation</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;motivation&#34;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In urban transportation environments, drivers often encounter various path (route) options when navigating to their destinations. This emphasizes the importance of navigational recommendation systems (NRS), which simplify decision-making and reduce travel time for users while alleviating potential congestion for broader societal benefits. However, recommending the shortest path may cause the flash crowd effect, and system-optimal routes may not always align the preferences of human users, leading to non-compliance issues. It is also worth noting that universal NRS adoption is impractical.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Herd Accountability from Auditing Privacy-Preserving Algorithms</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Paper (This prior work is published in Decision and Game Theory for Security&#xA;(GameSec 2023)): &lt;a href=&#34;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-50670-3_18&#34;&gt;https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-50670-3_18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;!---&#xA;![The herd audit concept.](/images/herd-audit/concept.png)&#xA;---&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;motivation&#34;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Privacy-preserving AI algorithms are widely adopted in various domains, but the lack of transparency might pose accountability issues. While auditing algorithms can address this issue, machine-based audit approaches are often costly and time-consuming.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Herd audit, on the other hand, offers an alternative solution by harnessing collective intelligence. Nevertheless, the presence of epistemic disparity among auditors, resulting in varying levels of expertise and access to knowledge, may impact audit performance. An effective herd audit will establish a credible accountability threat for algorithm developers, incentivizing them to uphold their claims.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Combating Misinformation on Online Social Platform</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Link to Paper (This work is published in 2023 21st International Symposium on Modeling and Optimization in Mobile, Ad Hoc, and Wireless Networks (WiOpt)): &lt;a href=&#34;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10349848&#34;&gt;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10349848&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;motivation&#34;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Misinformation has become a growing issue on online social platforms (OSPs), especially during elections or pandemics. To combat this, OSPs have implemented various policies, such as tagging, to notify users about potentially misleading information. However, these policies are often transparent and therefore susceptible to being exploited by content creators, who may not be willing to invest effort into producing authentic content, causing the viral spread of misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Privacy and Energy-Aware Split Deep Learning in Edge Camera Network</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Paper (This work is published in IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management): &lt;a href=&#34;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9941479&#34;&gt;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9941479&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;!---&#xA;![Edge Camera Network](/images/edge-camera-coalition/edge-camera.png)&#xA;---&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;motivation&#34;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recently, an increasing amount of application tasks have depended on deep learning (DL) inference models on Internet of Things (IoT) based camera networks. However, it is challenging to perform the inference of such resource-hungry DL models on the computationally limited IoT system. Compared to cloud computing, edge computing deploys resources near the end-users to reduce the transmission delay and retains the raw data on the trusted servers to mitigate privacy concerns. Since resources at the edge are limited, management like user association decisions, edge resources allocation, and device configuration with DL model parameter selection becomes essential.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

However, performing the inference tasks for DL applications on IoT devices is challenging due to the large computational demands of DL models. Recently, edge computing has offered us a solution by deploying resources near the end users. However, resources at the edge are still limited; thus, management issues, such as allocating the networking resources as well as the computing capabilities and configuring the devices appropriately for different applications, become essential.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
