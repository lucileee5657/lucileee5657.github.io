However, performing the inference tasks for DL applications on IoT devices is challenging due to the large computational demands of DL models. Recently, edge computing has offered us a solution by deploying resources near the end users. However, resources at the edge are still limited; thus, management issues, such as allocating the networking resources as well as the computing capabilities and configuring the devices appropriately for different applications, become essential.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
